Before anything else, please do the following:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Rank your confidence from 0-5 on each of the learning targets. 5 means ``I could teach a whole class about this;'' 0 means ``I am genuinely not sure I have heard these words before.''
    \item Rip all the pages apart.
    \item Write your name on this page and on each of the other pages of the quiz.
\end{itemize}

Then do the quiz! Some reminders:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Open notes, closed computer.
    \item If you need more room to write, use the back of the same learning target page, or ask me for some scratch paper.
    \item Read the questions carefully and make sure you're answering each part.
    \item Show all your work and explain all your thinking!
\end{itemize}

When you are done:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Rank your confidence from 0-5 on each of the learning targets. 5 means ``I absolutely nailed that question for sure;'' 0 means ``oof, I definitely didn't get that one.''
    \item Make double sure your name is on every page, including any scratch paper.
    \item Hand in your work, separated by learning target.
\end{itemize}

Have fun and do your best! I believe in u $\heartsuit$

\section{Learning target G2, version 1}
Are the graphs $G$ and $H$ on the previous page isomorphic? 
\begin{itemize}
    \item If so, give a relabeling, and convince me that it respects the edges.
    \item If not, carefully explain how you know for sure.

\section{Learning target G3, version 1}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Draw a tree in which the highest degree is 4.
    
    \vfill
    \item Draw a subgraph of $K_{3,3}$.

    \vfill
    \item Does the graph $G$ below have an Euler trail? If so, draw it; if not, explain how you know.
    \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=1.75]
        \foreach \x in {0,...,4}{
            \draw (0,0) \v -- (90+\x*72:1) \v -- (162+\x*72:2) \v -- (90+\x*72:2) -- (162+\x*72:1);

            }
        \end{tikzpicture}

\section{Learning target P2, version 2}
This is true: If $G'$ is a subgraph of a bipartite graph $G$, then $G'$ is bipartite.

\section{Learning target L1 / L2 / L3, version 2}
Consider the following statement: Every tree is planar.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item[\textbf{L1}.] Translate this into ``if-then'' form in human language:

    \vspace{2cm}
    and then translate your human ``if-then'' version into properly quantified symbols.

    \vspace{2cm}
    \item[\textbf{L2}.] Write the contrapositive, converse, and inverse of this statement in human words.

    Contrapositive:

    \vspace{2cm}
    Inverse:

    \vspace{2cm}
    Converse:

    \vspace{2cm}
    \item[\textbf{L3}.] Write the negation of the original statement in symbols, and translate it into human words.
