\item 
\textbf{(P5)
Consider the following theorem:} 

For all natural numbers $n$, if $n^{2}$ is even then $n$ is even. 

What follows is a supposed proof. Your job is to critique the proof by explaining what is wrong with it and by supplying a correct proof. Check it out:

    \begin{proof} Consider any $n \in \mathbb{N}$. Assume that $n^{2}$ is even. 
    
    By definition, $n^{2} = 2k$ for some $k \in \mathbb{N}$.
    
    Let's take square roots of each side giving us $\sqrt{n^{2}}=\sqrt{2k}$. 
    
    Simplifying, $n=\sqrt{2k}$.  
    
    Multiplying by $2$ top and bottom inside the square root, $n=\sqrt{\frac{2\cdot 2k}{2}}$. 
    
    So, $n=\sqrt{\frac{4\cdot k}{2}}$.  
    
    Pulling $4$ out of the square root, $n=2\cdot\sqrt{\frac{k}{2}}$.
    
    Let $m=\sqrt{\frac{k}{2}}$.
    
    Thus $n=2m$.
    
    Therefore, $n$ is an even number.
    
    So, our theorem is proved!?
    \end{proof}

\item 
\textbf{(L1, S3)} Suppose that $f$ is a function with domain $A$ and codomain $B$.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item
	Write the formal definition of $f$ being a \textbf{one-to-one} function (also called a \textbf{injective} function) using needed quantifiers and connectives.
	\item
	Assume that the domain $A$ and codomain $B$ for function $f$ are both finite sets and that $f$ is a one-to-one function. What is the necessary relationship between the cardinality of $A$ and the cardinality of $B$?  Explain.
\end{enumerate}


\item
\textbf{(L3, S4)} In analyzing relations on a set we have studied the reflexive, symmetric, and transitive properties but there are other interesting and important properties. One of them is the antisymmetric property. Here is the definition.

Given relation R on set A, R is \textbf{antisymmetric} if and only if 

		\[\forall x \in A\ \forall y \in A, (xRy \land yRx) \rightarrow x = y \]

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Write an \textbf{equivalent} definition of antisymmetric in logical symbols using the contrapositive of the original definition.
	\item Write the \textbf{negation} of this definition in logical symbols. Simplify as much as possible.
	\item Draw two directed graphs for different relations on the set A={w,x,y,z}, one that \textbf{IS} antisymmetric and one that is \textbf{NOT} antisymmetric.
\end{enumerate}

\item
\textbf{(S4)} Given a relation R on set A, here are the definitions of the symmetric and antisymmetric properties:

R is \textbf{symmetric} if and only if

        \[\forall x \in A\ \forall y \in A, xRy \rightarrow yRx \]

R is \textbf{antisymmetric} if and only if 

		\[\forall x \in A\ \forall y \in A, (xRy \land yRx) \rightarrow x = y \]

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Can a relation be neither symmetric nor antisymmetric? If yes, find an example. If no, explain why not.
    \item Can a relation be both symmetric and antisymmetric? If yes, find an example. If no, explain why not.
\end{enumerate}		

\item \textbf{(S4, S5)} Here is a relation R on set $A=\{1,2,3,4,5\}$.

\item (\textbf{P5})
Remember, an L-tromino is a shape consisting of three equal squares joined at the edges to form a shape resembling the capital letter L.  

Consider the following ``theorem'':  \\

\textit{``Theorem''}: For any integer $n \geq 1$, if one square is removed from a $2 \cdot 2^{n} \times 3 \cdot 2^{n}$ checkerboard, the remaining squares can be completely covered by L-shaped trominoes. 

What follows is a supposed proof. Your job is to critique the proof by explaining what is wrong with it:

\textit{``Proof''}:

We prove the theorem by mathematical induction. \\ 
Assume it is true for $k$ that a $2 \cdot 2^{k} \times 3 \cdot 2^{k}$ checkerboard with one square missing can be completely covered by L-shaped trominoes. We will show this implies it is true for $k+1$ that a $2 \cdot 2^{k+1} \times 3 \cdot 2^{k+1}$ checkerboard with one square missing can be completely covered by L-shaped trominoes.

Note that a $2 \cdot 2^{k+1} \times 3 \cdot 2^{k+1}$ can be split into four quadrants, each one a $2 \cdot 2^{k} \times 3 \cdot 2^{k}$ checkerboard.

The missing square on the $2 \cdot 2^{k+1} \times 3 \cdot 2^{k+1}$ checkerboard must occur in one of these four quadrants. 

By the induction assumption, this quadrant, which is of size $2 \cdot 2^{k} \times 3 \cdot 2^{k}$ and missing one square, can be completely covered by L-shaped trominoes. 

Now, place one tromino at the intersection point so that it covers one square from each of the other three quadrants. 

These three quadrants are each of size $2 \cdot 2^{k} \times 3 \cdot 2^{k}$ and missing one square. Thus, by the induction assumption, they can be completely covered with L-shaped trominoes. 

Therefore, we have shown that the entire $2 \cdot 2^{k+1} \times 3 \cdot 2^{k+1}$ checkerboard with one missing square can be completely covered by L-shaped trominoes. 

Hence, we have proved our theorem by mathematical induction. QED, bro!

\item (\textbf{P1}) 
Prove this theorem: For all natural numbers $n$, if $n^2$ is a multiple of 3, then $n$ is a multiple of 3.

\item (\textbf{P1 or P2?})
Prove or disprove: Every cycle is 2-colorable.

\item \textbf{(P3)} Construct a well-explained combinatorial proof of the following theorem:

For all natural numbers n, i, j, and k where $i+j+k=n$, $\frac{n!}{i! \cdot j! \cdot k!} = \binom{n}{i} \cdot \binom{n-i}{j}$.

Hint: You might think about words of a certain length made up of a certain number of certain letters.

\item \textbf{(P5)} Consider the following theorem: If $ab$ is even, then either $a$ is even or $b$ is even.

The following is an \textbf{incorrect} proof of the theorem:
\begin{quotation}
Assume that $a$ or $b$ is even. Without loss of generality, say that it's $a$. Then, by definition, we can write $a = 2k$ for some $k\in\mathbb{N}$. Thus:
\begin{align*}
    ab &= (2k) b \\
    &= 2kb \\
    &= 2(kb) = 2j,
\end{align*}
where $j = kb$ is a natural number. Therefore, by definition, $ab$ is even. \qed
\end{quotation}
Carefully explain what is wrong with this proof attempt.

\item (\textbf{P1}) 
Suppose that $m$ and $n$ are natural numbers, and that $p$ is a prime. Prove that if $p$ divides $m\cdot n$, then either $p$ divides $m$ or $p$ divides $n$.

\item (\textbf{P1}) Here's a sketch of a proof of a theorem: if $n^2$ is a multiple of 5, then $n$ is a multiple of 5. The proof is by contrapositive: assume $n$ is not a multiple of 5. Then $n$ is of the form $5k + j$, where $k$ and $j$ are integers and $j = 1, 2, 3, 4$. Now we'd like to show $n^2$ is not a multiple of 5. $n^2 = (5k+j)^2 = 25k^2 + 10kj + j^2$. So then we can just look at what happens when we square $j$. The squares of 1, 2, 3, and 4 are all not multiples of 5 (we should check this). So you can't write $n^2$ as a multiple of 5 (we should check this too). Yay, we win.

Use the idea of this proof to show that if $n^2$ is divisible by 7, then $n$ is divisible by 7.

\item Conway's Converger is a fun reorganization of the natural numbers into rows of lengths 1, 3, 5, 7, \ldots with some interesting properties. The first number in the row is written to the center of the row, and then the numbers are written alternately to the left and the right. Here's the first few rows:
\[
    \begin{array}{ccccccc}
   &    &    & 1  &    &    &    \\
   &    & 3  & 2  & 4  &    &    \\
   & 8  & 6  & 5  & 7  & 9  &    \\
15 & 13 & 11 & 10 & 12 & 14 & 16 \\
   &    &    & \vdots & &   &
    \end{array}
\]
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{(P1)} The furthest-right number in each of the rows above is a square, and in fact this is true for every row. Prove this is true.
    \item \textbf{(Q1)} Find a formula for the sum of the numbers in the $n$th row.
\end{enumerate}

\item \textbf{(P2, L1)} Let $P(n)$ be the proposition ``$n$ is a prime number''. Consider the following statement: 
\[ \forall n \in \mathbb{N}, P(n) \to (\exists k\in \mathbb{N}, n = 2k+1). \]
This statement is false. Explain why, and give a counterexample.

\item \textbf{(P3)} Give a combinatorial proof of the fact that each row of Pascal's triangle adds up to a power of 2:
\[\binom{n}{0} + \binom{n}{1} + \ldots + \binom{n}{n} = 2^n. \]

\item \textbf{(P4)} The following is true for all integers $n \geq 1$. Prove it using mathematical induction.
\[\frac{1}{1 \cdot 2} + \frac{1}{2 \cdot 3} + ... + \frac{1}{n(n+1)}=\frac{n}{n+1}\]

\item \textbf{(P5)} Here is a true theorem: If $n^2$ is a multiple of 3, then $n$ is a multiple of 3. 

Here is an \textbf{incorrect} proof of this theorem:
\begin{quotation}
This proof is by contrapositive. Suppose that $n$ is not a multiple of 3. Then there is some integer $k$ such that $n = 3k + 1$. Therefore, $n^2 = (3k+1)^2 = 9k^2 + 6k + 1 = 3(3k^2 + 2k) + 1$. Let $\ell = 3k^2 + 2k$; then $\ell$ is also an integer. Thus $n^2 = 3\ell + 1$, and so $n^2$ is also not a multiple of 3. \qed
\end{quotation}
For optional \textbf{P1} credit, fix this proof.


\item (\textbf{L1, L3}) Consider these two very similar-looking statements: 

$\exists x\in \mathbb{Z}\ \forall y \in \mathbb{Z}, x + y = 0$

$\forall y \in \mathbb{Z}\ \exists x\in \mathbb{Z}, x + y = 0$

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Translate both statements into words.
    \item Write in symbols the formal negation of both statements.
    \item Precisely one of these two statements is true. Which is it, and why?\\ (Moral: the order of quantifiers is super important.)
\end{enumerate}

\item (\textbf{L2}) We have a number of logical connectives but we really could have gotten away with fewer. For example, any time we wanted to say $P \iff Q$ we could have just said it with \textbf{AND}, \textbf{OR}, and \textbf{NOT} with $(P \land Q) \lor ( \lnot P \land \lnot Q)$. Write a truth table to show that these two statements are logically equivalent.


\item
\textbf{(L3, S4)} Consider the following statement about a relationship R on some set A:
        \[\exists x \in A \ \exists y \in A,\ xRy \land \lnot (yRx) \]
\begin{enumerate}
    \item 
    Write the formal simplified negation of this statement.
    \item
    Explain the meaning of the original statement and the meaning of its negation using familiar properties of relations.
\end{enumerate}

\item \textbf{(S1, S2)} Consider the sets $A = \{a\in\mathbb{N}: \exists k\in\mathbb{N}, a = 5k\}$ and $B = \{b\in\mathbb{N}: \exists j\in\mathbb{N}, b = 6j+1\}$.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Give an example of some number in $A\cap B$. Explain why you're right.
    \item Give an example of some number in $A\cap\overline{B}$. Explain why you're right.
\end{enumerate}

\item \textbf{(S3)} Another way functions (and more general relations) are sometimes represented is as a set of ordered pairs. For instance, if $f:\{1,2,3,4\}\to\mathbb{N}$ was given by $f(x) = x^2$, then we could write $f$ as the set $\{(1,1), (2,4), (3,9), (4, 16)\}$.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Let $g:\{a,b,c,d\}\to\{v,w,x,y,z\}$  be given by the set of ordered pairs \[\{(d,v), (a,x), (c,y), (b,w), (a,x), (c,z), (d,v)\}.\] Is $g$ a function? Why or why not?
\item Let $h:\{a,b,c,d\}\to\{v,w,x,y,z\}$ be given by the set of ordered pairs \[\{(c,x),(d,y),(a,y),(c,x),(b,z)\}.\]
I'll tell you for free that $h$ is a function. Is it injective? Is it surjective? Explain why or why not.
\end{enumerate}

\item \textbf{(S4, S5)}  Recall that the power set of $A$, written $\mathcal{P}(A)$, is the set of all subsets of $A$.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Write all of the elements of $\mathcal{P}(\{1,2,3\})$.
    \item We define a relation on $\mathcal{P}(\{1,2,3\})$ as follows: For all sets $X$ and $Y$ in the power set, $X$ is related to $Y$ if and only if $X$ and $Y$ have the same cardinality. Explain why this relation is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive (thus, is an equivalence relation).
    \item Write the equivalence classes for this relation.
    
\end{enumerate}

\item (\textbf{C1}) Suppose there is one of each of the following seven candy bars: Almond Joy, Butterfinger, Chick-o-Stick, Dove Bar, Everlastin Chew, Fifth Avenue, and GooGoo Cluster.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item How many ways could one choose five different candy bars to eat?
    \item How many ways could one choose five different candy bars to eat if a Butterfinger and a Fifth Avenue will not go well together and, therefore, should not both be chosen?
    \item How many ways could all seven candy bars be lined up in a row?
\end{enumerate}
 
\item (\textbf{C1, C3}) Our class consists of 24 individuals. Suppose that a committee of four individuals is to be selected to serve as an executive committee to handle mathematical disputes. Furthermore, suppose that Caz and Jamin refuse to serve together on the committee. How many different such committees are there? Solve this problem two different ways and discuss the different techniques you used.



\item (\textbf{C1, C2, C3}) In another one of Dr Bagley's classes, there are 26 students which he'd like to seat at six tables. He never wants to have more than 5 people at a table (because then somebody is forced to sit with their back to the screen).
\begin{enumerate}
    \item How many total seating arrangements are there, if students don't care what table they sit at? Carefully explain why the counting strategy you used is correct.
    \item How many total seating arrangements are there, if students \textbf{do} care what table they sit at? Carefully explain why the counting strategy you used is correct.
    \item \textbf{(NOTE: I suspect this problem is hard)} Suppose there is a group of 5 students who all need to be at separate tables. How many total seating arrangements are there in this case?  Carefully explain why the counting strategy you used is correct.
    \item \textbf{(NOTE: I suspect this problem is too hard)} Suppose there is a second group of 4 students who also all need to be at separate tables. Now how many total seating arrangements are there? Carefully explain why the counting strategy you used is correct.
\end{enumerate}

\item (\textbf{C1, C3}) Poker: five cards out of a deck of 52; 4 suits; 13 denominations in each suit
\begin{enumerate}
    \item A \textbf{full house} is a hand of five cards where you have three of one denomination and two of another -- for instance, $5\clubsuit$ $5\heartsuit$ $J\heartsuit$ $J\diamondsuit$ $J\spadesuit$. How many total full houses are there? Carefully explain why the counting strategy you used is correct.
    \item A \textbf{flush} is a hand of five cards where they all have the same suit -- for instance, $5 \clubsuit$ $8 \clubsuit$ $9 \clubsuit$ $Q \clubsuit$ $A \clubsuit$. How many total flushes are there? Carefully explain why the counting strategy you used is correct.
    \item Based on your answers to these questions, do you think a full house should beat a flush, or should a flush beat a full house? Explain your answer.
\end{enumerate}

\item \textbf{(C1, C3)} Suppose you have a huge box of animal crackers containing plenty of each of 10 different animals. Write a counting problem about giving animal crackers to people whose answer is $\textstyle\binom{10}{6}$, and carefully explain why the answer to your problem is $\textstyle\binom{10}{6}$.

\item \textbf{(C2)} Consider five-digit numbers $a = a_1 a_2 a_3 a_4 a_5$, where each digit $a_i$ comes from the set $\{1,2,3,4\}$. How many such numbers contain more even digits than odd digits? Carefully explain your answer.

    \item Find a recurrence relation for $s_{n}$.
    \item Find a closed formula for $s_{n}$.
\end{enumerate}
