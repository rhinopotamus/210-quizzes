# 210-quizzes
Quizzes and problem test bank for MATH 210 (Discrete Mathematics) using DMOI.

## Some explanations for what's going on here
This is a stack of LaTeX documents with a bunch of problems for a Discrete Mathematics class using DMOI. The mysterious letter-number combinations next to each item refer to the [Learning Targets](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iMYS1rcY-GBkqqT7M9b8KD9Uli4x7OotvyP4-Bc15HA/edit?usp=sharing) each problem assesses.

We went through the text in a weird order, and each quiz was cumulative, so there's questions from each chapter scattered about in each of the chapter quizzes.

I believe the "Problem Test Bank" has all of the questions from all of the quizzes, but I should probably qualify that "all" with an "almost." 

Mostly-complete solutions to each of the chapter quizzes are available upon request -- email me at sbagley@westminstercollege.edu.
